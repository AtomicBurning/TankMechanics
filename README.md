# TankMechanics
This is the submission for my Game Mechanics Unit

Please launch this project in Unreal ENgine 5.4.

This submission can be played in any scene - the gameobject is generated by my NewGameMode - and can be controlled via gamepad or keyboard. Keyboard controls should map to WASD and QE. Gamepad controls were designed around the SN30 Pro and can be controlled with the conntrol stick and the bumpers.
